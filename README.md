Material for my course of Computational Physics, in National and Kapodistrian University of Athens (2019-2020). 
A platform independent web-based environment of commonly used open source software is provided, 
for each student to be able to study the course's material 
without having the burden to install manually on a private computer the software on its own.

Python packages used in scientific computing and data science are taught through examples. 
The dependencies are kept to a good minimum:

 * Binder
 * Python 3.7
 * numpy
 * matplotlib
 * jupyter notebooks

and the students are encouraged to master them as much as they want, or not at all. 
*The usage of the present computational environment is optional* and is only meant to serve those that find it useful. 
The students are strongly encouraged to create their own favorite environment in 
their personal computer, once they feel ready to do so.

# Launch Interactive Computational Environment 
## Python3 (credits: Binder Foundation)
Click on the ``**launch binder button**'' 

[![Binder](http://mybinder.org/badge.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/theofil/CompPhysics/master)

to launch an interactive Python3 environment and play with templates and examples of computational algorithms taught in the course.
*Warning* the launching of the interactive environment takes approximately <b>*~3.5 minutes</b>, so be patient!
