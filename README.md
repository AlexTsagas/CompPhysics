Material for my course of Computational Physics, in National and Kapodistrian University of Athens (2019-2020). 
A platform independent web-based enviroment of commonly used open source software is provided, 
for each student to be able to study the course's material 
without having the burden to install manually on a private computer the software on its own.

Python packages used in scientific computing and data science are taught through examples. 
The dependencies are kept to a good minimum:

 * Binder
 * Python 3.7
 * numpy
 * matplotlib
 * jupyter notebooks

and the students are encouraged to master them as much as they want, or not at all. 
*The usuage of the present computational enviroment is optional* by the students enrolled in course. 
The students are strongly encouraged to create their own favorite enviroment in their personal computer, once they feel ready to do so.
