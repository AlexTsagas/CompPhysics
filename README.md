# Computational Physics -- National and Kapodistrian University of Athens  

![nkua logo](https://www.uoa.gr/fileadmin/user_upload/uoa_logo_gr.svg) 

This website provides a cloud-based **interactive** computing enviroment, for my course of Computational Physics [Υπολογιστική Φυσική Υ0338](https://eclass.uoa.gr/modules/document/?course=PHYS192), in National and Kapodistrian University of Athens (2019-2020). 

By using this interactive enviroment, the students are be able to study and **practise real implementations** of the course's material 
without having the burden to install manually on their own any software in a private computer.
*The usage of the present computational environment is optional* and is only meant to serve those that find it useful. 
The students are strongly encouraged to create their own favorite environment (C/C++, Fortran, Matlab, Java, R, Mathematica, Python, Julia ... you name it) in their personal computer, once they feel ready to do so.

### Launch Interactive Computational Environment (no registration needed)
Click on the **launch binder button** 

[![Binder](http://mybinder.org/badge.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/theofil/CompPhysics/master)

to launch an interactive Python3 environment and play with templates and examples of computational algorithms taught in the course.
*Warning* the launching of the interactive environment takes approximately <b>*~0.5-5 minutes</b>, depending on the load, so be patient!

### Or if you have a google account (free registration)
You can use your gmail account to open via http://colab.research.google.com all code write-ups. In that case you just need to browse the code in https://github.com/theofil/CompPhysics.


### Code examples
The code examples provided for demonstration purposes, are written having in mind three principles:

   * reflect the math forms taugh symbolically *as-they-appear* in the lecture
   * code lenght should be minimal and take least effort to comprehend
   * assume little, or zero programming skills 
   
That is to say, that the code is not always optimized having in mind efficiency and execution speed. 
Such fine tuning of the code, while important, can in some cases obscure transperency at first site.
Instead, it is purposefully attempted to demonstrate the core ideas of the underline algorithms, leaving 
higher order optimizations (which are often problem-specific) as work assigments for the students.

### External dependencies
Python packages used in scientific computing and data science are taught through examples. 
The dependencies are kept to a good minimum:

 * Binder
 * Python 3.7
 * numpy
 * matplotlib
 * jupyter notebooks
 * google colab
