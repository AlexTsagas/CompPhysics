# Computational Physics -- National and Kapodistrian University of Athens  

![nkua logo](https://www.uoa.gr/fileadmin/user_upload/uoa_logo_gr.svg) 

This website provides a custom made cloud-based **interactive** computing enviroment, for practising the themes of my course in Computational Physics [Υπολογιστική Φυσική Υ0338](https://eclass.uoa.gr/modules/document/?course=PHYS192), in National and Kapodistrian University of Athens (2019-2020). 

By using this interactive enviroment, the students are be able to study the course's material 
without having the burden to install manually on their own, software on a a private computer.
*The usage of the present computational environment is optional* and is only meant to serve those that find it useful. 
The students are strongly encouraged to create their own favorite environment (C/C++, Matlab, Java, R, Mathematica, Python, Julia ... you name it) in 
their personal computer, once they feel ready to do so.

### Launch Interactive Computational Environment (no registration needed)
Click on the **launch binder button** 

[![Binder](http://mybinder.org/badge.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/theofil/CompPhysics/master)

to launch an interactive Python3 environment and play with templates and examples of computational algorithms taught in the course.
*Warning* the launching of the interactive environment takes approximately <b>*~0.5-5 minutes</b>, depending on the load, so be patient!

### Or if you have a google account (free registration)
You can use your gmail account to open via http://colab.research.google.com all code write-ups. In that case you just need to browse the code in https://github.com/theofil/CompPhysics.


### Code examples

The code examples provided, are written having in mind two principles:
   * reflect the math forms and the algorithms taugh symbolically *as-they-appear* in the lecture
   * code lenght should be minimal and take least effort to comprehend. 
That is to say, that the code is not always optimized for efficiency and execution speed. 
Such optimizations, while important, can in some cases obscure the transperency of the steps executed by the code.
The code is attempted to be kept as simple as possible such as the core ideas of the underline algorithms emerge 
without much effort when reading the code. 
It also assumes, little or zero programming skills.

### External dependencies
Python packages used in scientific computing and data science are taught through examples. 
The dependencies are kept to a good minimum:

 * Binder
 * Python 3.7
 * numpy
 * matplotlib
 * jupyter notebooks
