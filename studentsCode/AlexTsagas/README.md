# Where to Write Python?

The Jypiter Notebook, that is integrated to Constantinos Theofilatos git repository, is a great way to start writing your programs. But, as you progress in coding 
you would be more comfortable to have a local text editor/ide installed in your machine to work with the programming language you prefer.

My advice would be to test 
a text editor, since it is more lightweight and versatile than an ide, but it comes to personal preference after all. I personally use Visual Code Studio to writy both Python and C\C++ code and I'm pretty fullfiled by it. You can find plenty of videos in youtube to help you get started.

**Try it yourself!**
